## Architecture Improvements

The new architecture provides several benefits:

1. **Centralized Entry Point**: All initialization happens in `main.py`, making it easier to understand the application flow.
2. **Unified Script Management**: The `script_manager.py` provides a single interface for managing all monitoring scripts.
3. **Improved Error Handling**: Better logging and error handling throughout the application.
4. **Cleaner Code Structure**: Separation of concerns between route definitions and application initialization.
5. **Better Documentation**: Comprehensive README and comments throughout the code.
